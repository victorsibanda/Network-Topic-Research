**What is an IP?**

IP stands for Internet Protocol, And an IP address is a unique number which is linked to the online activity of that IP. 

Internet Protocol is a set of requirements for addressing and routing data on the internet. IP can be used with several transport protocols, including TCP and UDP. The data sent via the internet is divided into small pieces called packet. IP information is attached to each packet which means that the information is sent to the correct place. Each device or Domain has a unique IP address.

* TCP is Transmission Control Protocol, which is a connection-oriented protocol that computers use to communicate over the internet. It is the main protocol for IP Networks. TCP provides error checking and guarantees delivery of data. 
* UDP is User Datagram Protocol, it is a connectionless protocol that works like TCP without error-checing and recovery services. UDP sends datagrams to the recipient whether they recieve them or not.
